### Overview

Sleep Guardian leverages Machine Learning to predict sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea.
The project uses Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN models, deployed via a Streamlit app, to provide early detection and personalized treatment insights.

### Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)

Streamlit (for interactive UI)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (data visualization)

### Features

✅ Data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, encoding)
✅ Model training (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest)
✅ Evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)
✅ Streamlit-based GUI for predictions
